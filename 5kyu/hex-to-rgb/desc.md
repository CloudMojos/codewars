When working with color values it can sometimes be useful to extract the individual red, green, and blue (RGB) component values for a color. Implement a function that meets these requirements:

Accepts a case-insensitive hexadecimal color string as its parameter (ex. "#FF9933" or "#ff9933")
Returns a Map<String, int> with the structure {r: 255, g: 153, b: 51} where r, g, and b range from 0 through 255
Note: your implementation does not need to support the shorthand form of hexadecimal notation (ie "#FFF")

Example
"#FF9933" --> {r: 255, g: 153, b: 51}


1 -> 01
2 -> 02
3 -> 03
4 -> 04
5 -> 05
6 -> 06
7 -> 07
8 -> 08
9 -> 09
10 -> 10
11 -> 1A
